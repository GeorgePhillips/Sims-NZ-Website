<p> The POLYDROPPER snap-on clips are used in conjunction with the POLYDROPPER.</p>
<p> INSTALLATION OF POLYDROPPER</p>
<ol>
<li> Working on the side of the fence which will receive most pressure from stock, position the dropper to the fence and hold steady with your knee.</li>
<li> Apply the Poly Dropper SNAP-ON clip to the back of the dropper and with both hands on the fence wire, push the clip over the wire with the thumbs.</li>
<li> Barbed or plain wire may be safely clipped to droppers, using the Poly Dropper CLIP TOOL. Simply load the snap on clip into the tool, and holding the dropper in the space between the barbs, force the clip tool handle upwards.</li>
</ol>
<p> Twist clips around second to top and second to bottom wires to prevent droppers sliding along the fence from stock pressure. Leave remaining wires clipped, allowing them to be restrained.</p>
<p> For best effect droppers should be clear of the ground. Keep fence lines weed sprayed to avoid fire damage. </p>
