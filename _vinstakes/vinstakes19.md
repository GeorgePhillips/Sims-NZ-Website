### Features:

### Vinstakes are now available with plain base or fully tagged.

1.  High strength beam configuration takes high shock and crop loads.
2.  Galvanised for long life, user friendly.
3.  Flat sides of post give stability in wet unstable soils.
4.  Multiple wire tags on both sides of the stake allow foliage/cane wires to be positioned from both sides of the vine.
5.  Controlled stake &#39;springflex&#39; ensures mechanical harvester can remove crop with minimal beating. Vines suffer less damage, more whole berries are harvested and less leaf litter falls into the harvester catchers.
6.  Pruning - exisiting mechanical pruners do not foul the stakes.
7.  Installation is easy with manual or mechanical drivers.
8.  Soils compact within the stake stabilising it within the soil. A galvanised anti sink rod may be inserted through a lower set of tabs to rest on the top of the soil.
9.  Sprinkler risers (1&quot; BSP) press neatly into the top of the stake.
10.  Available in a variety of lengths. Tagged full length or with plain base below drip line wire.
11.  Foliage wires slot easily into tags without having to angle the wire.
12.  Multiple wire tags allow additional wires if trellis design is changed
