We have available different sized post caps suitable for both steel and wooden posts.

These caps are made from tough UV stable virgin polypropolene.

The caps designed for the metal posts fit snugly and will remain permanently in your posts for years, virtually eliminating costly tearing from sharp steel post tops.

Post caps provide protection that can cost less than 7% of the total outlay for birdnetting. Please contact us to quote for the quantity needed to suit your vineyard.
