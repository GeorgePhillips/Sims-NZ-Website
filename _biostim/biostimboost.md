### What is it?

Pasture Boost is a high quality, organic certified liquid refined from fish bi-product. It is made in New Zealand and is also available in Australia.

### What does it do?

Pasture Boost reactivates the soil enhancing pasture growth and ensuring strong root devlopment.

### How does it work?

Pasture Boost encourages microbial activity within the rootzone. This activity favours and stimulates the metabolism of the plant. A strong root system increases a plants resistance to fungal and insect attack and to environmental stress.

### Will it upset my spray equipment?

Pasture Boost is put through ceramic filters and is guaranteed down to 5 microns. This allows for trouble free spraying.

### How much do I have to use to get results?

Pasture Boost is highly concentrated and is diluted 400 to 1 for broad acre application. The principle &quot;less is best&quot;should be adhered to as too strong a mix could stall the plant. Extensive trials have been done and this economic ratio has shown to give the best results.

### How often can I use Pasture Boost?

Your pasture will thrive on fortnightly applications of Pasture Boost. The Pasture Boost foliar feed program features constant application throughout the year. This may be a new concept to many growers, but it is quite logical to appreciate that if you feed your animals a month?s food in a day, then they will be starving by day thirty.

### What makes Pasture Boost different from other products on the market?

Pasture Boost is a unique formulation derived from the refining of deep sea fish bi-product. It is not artificially heated during the refining process. The actual process is a trade secret well guarded after 10 years of extensive research which has given us the magic liquid called Pasture Boost.

### Who uses Pasture Boost?

Growers - both organic and conventional - have been using Pasture Boost successfully in New Zealand since the year 2000. There has been extensive use in market gardens, large acre crops and of course pasture.

### Can I use Pasture Boost with other products that I have always used?

Pasture Boost has been used in the past with other products. Our philosophy is to encourage the grower to try it on its own. Pasture Boost builds a plants resistance to both fungal and insect attack - why have a shed full of different types and formulas when Pasture Boost could be all that you need.

### How will my stock react to pasture treated with Pasture Boost?

Stock normally graze in spasmodic fashion - they move quickly from point to point seeking tastier, more luxuriant, grasses. However after the application of Pasture Boost, it quickly becomes apparent that the herd begins and generally maintains, even grazing throughout the paddocks. Animal health is rapidly improved once stock begin regular grazing of pasture treated with Pasture Boost. For the farmer, this translates into an improvement of the grass conversion rate.

### Is there a withholding period associated with Pasture Boost?

No. Stock can graze immediately after the application of Pasture Boost.

The future of our industry depends on the innovative approach taken to manage our respective resources to achieve both economical and long-term ecological sustainability.

#### Added benefits of treating pasture with Pasture Boost are:

The reduction of parasites that would normally inhabit these paddocks and potentially re-infect grazing animals.

The reduction of scouring of the herd, including new calves.

#### Recommended Application &amp; Dilution Rates:

A recommended application cycle of 10 /14 days throughout the growing season.  
Guaranteed to 5.0 microns - NO CLOGGING OF SPRAY NOZZLES
