### What is BioStim?
Bio-Stim is a fish emulsion and soil stimulant that is produced through natural anaerobic digestion processes.

### Will it clog up my spray equipment? Most fish products I have used in the past have had lumps in it.
Simply answered: No. This highly refined product is filtered through ceramic filters and is guaranteed to a level of 5 microns and will not cause clogging of drippers.

### When should I apply BioStim?
Good timing guarantees peak performance; the time of day, the time of the month and year are relevant to include into the particular crop cycle. Early morning is the time the plant normally absorbs dew so foliar spraying early in the day will coincide with this natural feeding cycle to improve results. It is worth noting that plants do not absorb foliar nutrients in temperatures exceeding 32&cent;&ordf; C. The ascending moon cycle is a prime time for foliar feeding for enhancing top growth. Application during the descending moon encourages root development.

### How should I apply BioStim?
It has been found that foliar application is the best technique to achieve the precision required for efficient plant management. Balanced growth is most accurately measured at the leaf. Data from leaf analysis can often paint a different picture to that of soil analysis. This relates to complex nutrient relationships in the soil, where imbalances can create &ldquo;lockups&rdquo;. Other influences that affect a plant&rsquo;s capacity to feed itself from the soil are environmental conditions and disease or nematode problems that affect the roots.

### Can I put it through my fertigation system?
Yes. The suggested fertigation rate is 200:1 BioStim to water. This should be introduced during the middle portion of your normal irrigation cycle. Many vineyards have calculated their ratio from vine numbers per hectare ensuring each vine vine gets 2mls of BioStim per application. The CEC of your soil will ultimately determine what frequency and concentration the BioStim should be applied to maximise plant growth. (Median range for CEC is 12 &ndash; 25 for soils / M E / 100 g).

### How do I combat diseases and pests with BioStim?
BioStim has a 10% natural oil property, which has been indicated by farmers in the field to reductions in insect damage when used in a foliar application. BioStim is also proven in the fight against red spider mite in commercial flower crops.
