<p> The Spiralfast Wire Tension Indicator provides an easy and quick check that a wire is at its recommended tension. </p>
<p> It simply hangs on the wire with the tension indicated by the position of the wire against the scale on the strap. </p>
<p> The strap folds down for easy carrying. </p>
<p> As the indicator functions by its own weight and built-in leverage its accuracy is maintained for life. </p>
<p> Order your indicator from SIMS and enjoy the accuracy in your future fencing jobs </p>
