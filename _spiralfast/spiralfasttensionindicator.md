The Spiralfast Wire Tension Indicator provides an easy and quick check that a wire is at its recommended tension.

It simply hangs on the wire with the tension indicated by the position of the wire against the scale on the strap.

The strap folds down for easy carrying.

As the indicator functions by its own weight and built-in leverage its accuracy is maintained for life.

Order your indicator from SIMS and enjoy the accuracy in your future fencing jobs
