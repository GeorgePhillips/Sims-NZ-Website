SPIRALFAST Tension Ties are made from heavily galvanised spring steel with a special spiral design and gritted coating to tightly grip the wire. They are easily applied by hand and no special tools are required.

The joiners work using a simple principle of physics, as the tension on the wire increases the spiral is pulled tighter, gripping the wire more and more. ![Step 1 in Applying Spiralfast.](/img/large/TT2.jpeg)

Place the middle of the wire joiner about 5cm (2inches) from the end of the first wire you wish to join. Wrap in the direction of the spiral until the end of the joiner &#39;clicks&#39; into place. When wrapping the joiner onto the wire hold the joiner close to the center to gain more leverage. ![Step 1 in Applying Spiralfast.](/img/large/TT3.jpeg)

Poke the end of the second wire into the gap at the center between the wire joiner and the first wire and push it through so that both wires cross and overlap each other by about 5cm (2inches) at the center. This overlap at the center is important as it physically prevents the joiners from unwinding. Now wrap the second end of the joiner onto the wire in the same way as the first. ![The spiralfast system](/img/large/TT1.jpeg)

The end result will be a strong clean join that will hold the full load of the wire itself.
